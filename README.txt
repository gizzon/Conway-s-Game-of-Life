Application Programming in Java- Homework 4
Summer 2019

Conwayâ€™s Game of Life

Compilation and Execution Instructions:
  In order to compile + run the Game of Life simulation, you must navigate to
  the appropriate directory and then run the "Builer.sh" file and then the
  "Runner.sh" file. Command-line arguments are not required, and the program
  will prompt you for input while it is running.


Input and Output Examples:
  Within the files there are 5 examples of boards that can be used to simulate
  the Game of Life. Of the 5 examples, there are some boards that are labeled
  "bad". These boards do not generate an output board because the formatting
  does not meet the required specifications. For board examples that have the
  correct formatting, such as "board1.txt", the corresponding output files are
  labeled as "board1_output#.txt". The example outputs for the properly formatted
  boards were run with 5 ticks.

Documentation:
  The JavaDoc has already been created and is in the files submitted. However,
  if you would like to run the generation of javadocs on your own, run the
  "JavaDocGen.sh" file.
